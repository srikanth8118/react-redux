Component in React:
-- it is blue print, Components are reusable small pieces. 
-- the components in react are useful to bulid the the web applications 
-- In react library, components are faster compared to the angular js components

Render method:
-- render method helps to the view the html page
-- when the render method is invoked, the components can displayed on the front End 
-- it is faster and helps in dom manipulation

JSX:
--it is known as javascript Xml
-- JSX uses Html syntax
-- the browser cannot understand the jsx directly it should be converted using a transpiler
Example:
render(){
	return(
	<div>this is a Component</div>

	)
} 

Angular vs react:
--Angular is an opensource javascript framework.
--Angular has a lots of concepts like directives, components, services,
--In Angular, it is easier to fix the issuses. we can find the solution with the help of google
--Angular uses two way binding which is not good for performance
-- Angular uses Html templates

React:
-- React is an Javascript framework
--React only uses the components
--it is difficult to resolve the issuses in react
--react is JSX synatax 
-- React is faster when compared to the Angular

Virtual DOM:
-- Virtual Dom is an good advantage in React
-- it compares the current DOM with the future predicted DOM. We can make minimal changes in the code using different Algorithm
-- Virtual DOM is faster compared to the DOM 
-- it will compare the previous  Dom using the snapshot and predicts the updated Dom. It is known as diffing.

State:
--the data that is managed within the Component is known as state
-- it is muttable
-- good in performance


props:
-- the data which is to be transfferd from parent component to child component
-- It is immmutable
-- not good in performance

Steps Involved in converting ES6 nto ES5 syntax:
1. Firstly, we have load the dev dependencies into our working directory
2. Required dev dependencies are:
	--  babel-core
	--  babel-loader
	--  babel-preset-es2015
	--  babel-prest-stage-1
Here Babel is a transpiler used to convert ES6 to ES5
3. Wehave to use node package manager to install the dependencies
	npm install --save -dev babel-core bable-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-1
4.Now, we have build webpack.config.js file. It is an module loader
5. The transpiled ES5 code will be output in bundle.js
6. to convert the code we have use the command webpack-dev-server

React DOM:
-- the react-dom is an npm dependency
--it is used to render the react component on the html page
